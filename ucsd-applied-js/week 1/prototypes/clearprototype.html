//Until now I've been extending the base object, now I create another object and then inheriting from Person.

//Create a new object of type Customer by defining its constructor. It's not 
//related to Person for now.
var Customer = function(name) {
    this.name = name;

//Now I link the objects and to do so, we link the prototype of Customer to 
//a new instance of Person. The protype is the base that will be used to 
//construct all new instances and also, will modify dynamically all already 
//constructed objects because in Javascript objects retain a pointer to the 
//prototype

//Now I can call the methods of Person on the Customer, let's try, first 
//I need to create a Customer.

//If I add new methods to Person, they will be added to Customer, but if I
//add new methods to Customer they won't be added to Person. Example:
Customer.prototype.setAmountDue = function(amountDue) {
    this.amountDue = amountDue;
};
Customer.prototype.getAmountDue = function() {
    return this.amountDue;
};

//Let's try:       
myCustomer.setAmountDue(2000);
console.log(myCustomer.getAmountDue());
//While as said I can't call setAmountDue(), getAmountDue() on a Person.

//The following statement generates an error.
john.setAmountDue(1000);
